        <h1>Know About Me</h1>
        <p>I am Rajvi Amin. I was born on 5 September 2008. My father's name is Mr. Harshil Amin and my mother's name is Mrs. Varsha Amin. I study in class 7 .  Before four months, I came to know about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehatjr.com/">Whitehat junior</a> which is a platform that teaches students, who are less than 14 years of age, coding. I joined it immediately. When I joined it I was very excited to know about their coding ciricullum. I have had many classes with whitehat junior and I have learnt many things in coding. I have created many games with the help of whitehat junior's support. It is an awesome platform to learn coding. Everyone should join it.</p>
